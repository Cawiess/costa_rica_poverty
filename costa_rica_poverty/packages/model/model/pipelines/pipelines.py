'''
This module contains the Sklearn pipelines which gathers the preprocessors and analyzers
into an ordered sequence of operations. These pipelines are then executed by the main.py module.

### DATA PREPROCESSING
preprocessing_pipeline = Pipeline(
    [
        (
            "Preprocessing pipeline step One",
            pp.ColumnLabelNormalizer()
        ),
        (
            "Preprocessing pipeline Step Two",
            pp.ColumnValueNormalizer()
        )
    ]
)


### DATA FILTERING AND VARIABLE SELECTION
filtering_pipeline = Pipeline(
    [
        (
            "Filtering pipeline step One",
            print('Step one')
        ),
        (
            "Filtering pipeline Step Two",
            print('Step two')
        )
    ]
)
